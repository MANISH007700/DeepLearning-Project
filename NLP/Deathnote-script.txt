Deathnote Script:


Within the spreading darkness

I pledged a vow to the revolution

I can't let anybody interrupt it

I'm going to change

The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...

I'm going to change

The dream into reality

The ending

That everybody wants

Within the spreading darkness

I pledged our vow to the revolution

I can't let anybody interrupt it

Someday I'll show you

A bright and ideal

World

SHINIGAMI REALM

What?
Two death's heads again?

Hah! I win.
Don't hold it against me.

Hey Ryuk... Do you wanna join us?

Join us, for once.

No, I'm okay.

I didn't do anything
but he still got upset...

Really? And then?

What's the matter, Yagami?

Please translate the sentence.

Follow the teachings of God.

Then the blessings of the sea
will become bountiful...

And there will be no storms.

Today, at approximately 11 a. m. in
Kanagawa Prefecture in Yokohama,

the body of a man appearing
to be about 30 years old

was found in an apartment,
covered in blood.

Kanagawa Police have opened
a homicide investigation.

In other news...

Today, shortly after noon,

Naoki Kofuji, 35, was arrested
in connection with the murder of

a 25-year-old female
he was living with

in the Shibuya district
of Tokyo.

Day in and day out. - -
the same thing 0 var and 0 var again.

Jeez... It's so ridiculous...

This world...

...is rotten.

REBIRTH

No way! You went to see that?

It was such a waste of time.
I shoulda' asked for a refund!

Well, you did watch it...

Death Note... Directly translated,
a notebook of death...

How to use it...

The human whose name is written
in this note...

shall die?

So stupid...

This is so sick.

It's no different
from a chain letter.

"The human whose name is written
in this note shall die... "? C 'mon.

Seriously...
something's the matter with me.

This note will not take effect
unless the writer

has the person's face in their mind
when writing his/her name. Therefore...

People sharing
the same name will not be affected.

If the cause of death is written

within 40 human seconds
of writing the person's name,

it will happen.

If the cause of death
is not specifi?ed,

the person will simply die
of a heart attack.

After writing the cause of death,

details of the death
should be written

in the next 6 minutes
and 40 seconds.

So you can let people die
peacefully or make them suffer.

A prank this intricate
isn't too bad, I guess.

Write in their name and they die, huh...

This is so stupid!

Wait a minute...

If someone actually dies,
does that make me a murderer?

No way. That's impossible.

The assailant who killed
six people yesterday...

at a busy shopping district
in Shinjuku...

has now taken
eight people hostage,

including children and teachers,
in this daycare center.

The police have now identifi?ed
the suspect

as 42-year-old Kurou Otoharada,
unemployed.

The police will begin negotiations
with the suspect.

KUROU OTOHARADA

A heart' attack in
forty seconds. - - night?

Well, that is not clear
at the moment.

You can't help but be worried
for the hostages right now.

Absolutely.

This has been a report
from the scene.

Thank you very much.

What do you think, Mr. Hashimoto?

Well, I'm hoping for
a quick resolution to this.

Oh well, nothing happened.

What did I expect?

Just a minute...

There seems to be
something happening.

The hostages are coming out!

They all seem to be all right!

And now it looks like
the SWAT team is entering!

Has the suspect been arrested?!

Yes!

We just received word

that the suspect has died
inside the daycare center!

The suspect is dead!

Dead?!

KUROU OTOHARADA

The police are strongly denying
that they shot the suspect!

Could he have felt cornered...
and committed suicide?

According to one of the hostages,
"the suspect suddenly collapsed. "

A heart attack...

N- No way...

This is a coincidence.
It's gotta be coincidence!

Light!

It's almost 6:30. Don't you have
your prep course tonight?

Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

Death Note...

But if this really works...

It's worth testing it out once more.

So I guess it will have
to be another criminal.

But it can't be someone
too famous.

If he dies, it's possible news
of it will be covered up.

I need an immediate result.

Hey, Ryo baby!

W- What is it, Sudou?

Lend me some money...
2000 yen will do.

W- What? Again?

Sudou...

- Shall I kill him?
- What? You refusing?

No, I'd better avoid
people around me.

No... Why should I worry?

No one would care if one or
two people like him died.

Now we can go to
the arcade after school.

Maki, wanna party with
some guys tomorrow?

Absolutely!

Hey, me too!

Damn it, Mom!

She's not here to pick me up!

Damn it... It's sickening.
Every single one of them...

I'd do society a favor
by killing them.

Hey girl!

Wanna come and play with us?

Hey Taku!
You've got a beauty there!

I'm Takuo Shibuimaru.

Shibutaku, for short.

C'mon and join me... pretty girl.

I don't think so.

She doesn't think so!

She's so cute!

C'mon, grab her...
get those clothes off!

You sure?

S- Stop...!

Please!

Stop!

TAKUO SHIBUIMARU
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

Now let's see...
What'll happen!

Hey wait!

Taku! Watch out!

This... This proves it!

The Death Note is real!

Taku!

I- Idiot!

He just jumped out in front of me.

Now then...

I'd better get going.

It's been five days... since...

All right...

I'd better get going...

Huh? You going out, Ryuk?

This place is barren...
everywhere you go.

I dropped my Death Note.

You really messed up big time!

Hey, weren't you carrying around
a second one behind the old man's back?

You saying you lost both?

And do you know
where you dropped it?

The Human World.

- What?!
- What?

Welcome home.

You're early, Light.

Yeah.

I'm back, Mom.

Oh... The results of the national
practice entrance exams?

Hurry!

Here.

Goodness! Number one again!

You really did your best, Light!

Well yeah.

I'll be studying,
so don't interrupt me.

All right.

Oh Light...
Do you want anything?

Anything at all?

Not really, Mom.

I already have what I want...

You seem to like it.

Why so shocked?

I'm Ryuk, the Shinigami,
who dropped that notebook.

From what I just saw...

You're already aware that
it's no ordinary notebook.

A Shinigami... huh.

I'm not shocked, Ryuk.

In fact...
I've been waiting for you, Ryuk.

Oh?

I didn't think
a Shinigami's Notebook was real...

but after seeing its results,
I can act with certainty.

I see.
You've really surprised me...

I've heard of Death Notes getting down
to the Human World a few times before.

But you're the first one to use it
to this extent in just five days.

Most people would be
too scared to try it out.

I'm prepared, Ryuk.

I used the Death Note knowing
it belonged to a Shinigami.

And now the Shinigami's here.

So what'll happen to me?

Are you going to take my soul?

Huh? What's that about?

Is it some fantasy you humans
came up with?

I'm not going to do
anything to you.

Once the Death Note lands
in the Human World,

it belongs to the Human World.

In other words, that belongs to you.

It belongs to... me?

If you don't want it,
give it to some other human.

But if you do that,

all memory of the Death Note
will be erased from your mind.

So there isn't a price
for using the Death Note?

Well, if anything,
there's...

only the fear and pain humans who have
used the Death Note will experience.

And when you die...

I'll be the one to write
your name on my Death Note.

Don't think for a moment,
that any human...

who's used the Death Note
can go to Heaven or Hell.

That's all.

You'll find out about it
after you die.

Light...

Don't worry.

Go ahead.

What?

I brought some apples,
they're from our neighbor.

Why is it so dark in here?

You'll ruin your eyesight!

What's going on?

Mom can't see him?

That notebook...
originally belonged to me.

And since you're the one using it,
you're the only one who can see me...

and of course, only you...

Can hear my voice.

In other words,
the Death Note is a bond

between Light the human
and Ryuk the Shinigami.

Tasty.

Let me ask you one more thing.

Why did you choose me?

Hey, are you listening?

Hmm... apples in the
Human World are awesome.

What would you call them? Juicy?

Answer my question.

I didn't choose you.

I just dropped the notebook.

Did you think you were "chosen"
because you were smart?

Don't flatter yourself.

It just happened to fall around here...
and you just happened to pick it up.

That's all.

That's why I wrote the explanation
in English,

the most popular language
in the Human World.

Then why did you drop it?!

Don't tell me it was by mistake

after you went to the trouble and
wrote all those instructions.

Why'd I drop it?

...because I was bored.

Bored?

In fact, Shinigami these days
have so much time on their hands.

They're either taking a nap
or gambling.

If others see you studiously
scribbling names in the Death Note,

they'll say, "what are you working
so hard for?" and laugh at you.

Writing the names of other Shinigami
doesn't work.

But since we live
in the Shinigami Realm,

it's no fun at all to kill people
who live in the Human World!

So I figured it would be more fun
to come down here myself.

But you sure wrote a lotta names.

But Why'd you write down
the cause of death

only for that guy who
was hit by the truck?

Without the cause of
death written down,

they all die of heart attacks.

That's the best thing about
the Death Note, Ryuk.

I can write down
the names of the criminals...

and slowly reduce
the number of evil people.

What's the point?

Any fool can figure it out if someone
is just "eliminating the bad guys. "

I want the world to know...
of my existence!

And that there's someone
who is passing judgment onto them!

But... what's the point
in passing judgment?

Why do it?

I was bored... too.

Naturally, I didn't believe it at first.

But that Death Note has
the supernatural power...

to tempt people to want
to try it at least once.

I- I killed them...

Two men- - - I killed them!

Human lives...
shouldn't be taken so lightly!

Do I have the right to
judge people like that?

No...

I'm not wrong!

I always thought about this...

The world is rotten!

And that rotten people
should die!

Someone...

Someone must do it!

Even if it means sacrifi?cing
one's conscience and life!

Things can't stay... like this!

Even if someone else had
picked up the Death Note...

would they be able to erase
unwanted people from this world?

No way]

But I can... I can do it!

In fact, I'm the only one
who can do it!

And I will...
with the Death Note!

I'll change the world!

At first, I kept writing the names
of criminals...

like I was cleaning up the world.

So that in time,
no one would do evil.

While those guilty ones who truly
deserved to be punished for their crimes,

die of heart attacks...

people who were immoral
or harass others

will slowly be erased through
illness or accidents.

Then the world would truly
move in the right direction.

And I would create a new world of
earnest, kind humans.

Then you'd be the only one left...
with a bad personality.

Huh? What're you saying?

Ryuk...

I'm probably the best,
most diligent honor student in Japan.

And I...

will become the god
of this new world!

Humans...

are interesting, after all.

TO BE CONTINUED

I dreamed a dream
that no one could see

I threw away everything
that I didn't need

I'm holding these feelings

That I can't give up in my heart

Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifi?ce

In between reality and my ideal

I can't hold back
the flooding impulses

Because I have a strong desire

To accomplish

I'm not weak enough to believe

Any of these negative perceptions

I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude

PREVIEW

KIRA, KILL EVERYONE.

SEND MESSAGE?
SEND

The entire world is watching...

to see what happens
if anyone defies me... L.

What's wrong? Why don't you say something?
U-Unbelievable.
I had to check to be sure.
Who would have thought you could have done this?
Kira, it seems you can kill people without direct contact.
I couldn't believe it before seeing it with my own eyes.
Listen to me, Kira.
If you just killed the man on-screen, Lind L. Tailor,
you just killed a man who was scheduled to be executed today.
It wasn't me.
What?!
This criminal is someone who the police caught secretly.
His capture wasn't broadcast on television or the internet.
It seems that even you couldn't get information on him.
He got you.
But I, L... do exist!
So come on! Try and kill me!
Why that...!
- What's wrong? Do it quickly! - What's going on?! This is unreal!
- C'mon! Kill me! - Are you trying to die, L?!
- What's going on? - It's Kira versus L!
It's a live murder!
- Come on, Kira! - This is scary!
Try and kill me!
What's the matter? Can't you do it?!
It seems that you can't kill me.
So, there are some people that you can't kill.
You've given me a good clue.
I'll tell you something good in return.
I told you that this is a live broadcast worldwide, but...
This is only being broadcast in the Kanto region of Japan.
I was planning on broadcasting this in different areas at different times,
but it seems that I no longer need to.
Now I know that you are based in the Kanto region.

Within the spreading darkness

I pledged a vow to the revolution

I can't let anybody interrupt it

I'm going to change

The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...

I'm going to change

The dream into reality

The ending

That everybody wants

Within the spreading darkness

I pledged our vow to the revolution

I can't let anybody interrupt it

Someday I'll show you

A bright and ideal

World

Members of the ICPO...
I am L.

Regardless of how men y suspects
there ere,

there's a strong possibility
that they're Japanese.

Kira, I have a pretty good idea behind
your motive and why you're doing this.

But what you're doing is... evil!

W- Why that...!

Try and kill me!

- I am justice!
- What's going on?!

- I'm saving the meek that fear evil!
- This is unreal!

I'm the man who will become
the god of the ideal, new world!

L...

Kira...

- I will definitely find and finish you!
- I will definitely find and finish you!

- lam...
- lam...

- justice!
- Justice!

SERIAL MURDER
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HQ

Until now, there have been
3,029 responses

about the murders from
telephone calls, etc.

Most of them are from
curious members of the public...

But there are fourteen people
who say that

they either "know the killer"
or "have seen the killer. "

Each account was followed up
and recorded carefully.

But no one had information that hasn't
already been released to the public.

There are also 21 people
who claim they are Kira.

We didn't want to rule out
any possibilities...

So all 21 people
were put on record and filed.

Okay.

Next, the victims.

Sir!

Upon further investigation, we have
confirmed that information

of the heart attack victims was, in fact,

publicly available in Japan
prior to their deaths.

Also...

Concerning L's request
that we investigate

the times of death for each victim...

We found they occurred between 4 p. m.
until 2 a. m. on weekdays Japan's time.

68% of them occurred between
8 p. m. and 12 midnight.

Furthermore, we have
a wide variation of times

on Saturdays, Sundays,
and holidays.

That information is very interesting.

Judging from those times of death...
the culprit may be a student.

I have other grounds for this belief.

The perpetrator is probably driven by
their own idealistic sense of justice.

He's probably driven by
his own idealistic sense of justice.

They may even be trying
to become a god.

It is a deduction from
a very childish mentality.

I can't believe that...

This is just a mere possibility.

But please get rid of the fi?xed idea
that the culprit couldn't be a student.

Considering various possibilities
is the shortest route to arresting Kira.

Please continue
your investigative report.

Y- Yes...

Has anyone else noticed anything?

Um, yes...

What is it, Matsuda?

Umm... I'm in no way saying this
to give credit to Kira's actions...

but for the past few days, worldwide...
and especially in Japan...

the number of violent crimes more serious
than robbery has dropped drastically.

Well...

I suppose that's to be expected...

AFB/thing else?

L, that about sums up
our investigative report for today.

Thank you, everyone. I feel as if
we're closing in on the culprit.

Please forgive me,
but I'd like to make another request.

I want the teams investigating
the victims, news and internet

to examine closely once more

how the victims' identities
were made public in Japan.

I want to know if pictures of
the victims' faces were shown.

I leave it to you.

Chief...

You seem very tired...

Thanks...

I've been pulling all-nighters lately.

What I said about crimes
dropping drastically...

Now that I think about it,
everyone knows that already.

I'm sorry.

What are you talking about?

Keep speaking the truth...

Especially when it's about things
people hesitate to bring up.

However, if you had gone
on to say that...

we should commend Kira for admirably
reducing crime rates,

now that might have been a problem.

I- Impossible! Support that murderer?

I'm just kidding.

Just as I expected, Light!

Hey! Did you understand any
of that by yourself?

Huh? Yeah, kind of...

Oh, it seems like Dad's home.

Welcome home, Dear.

He's home early!

Hey! At least figure out
the last problem by yourself.

I will after dinner!

Really...

Helping your little sister
do her homework...

you sure have confidence.

Yeah. There's one thing that gives me
an advantage against the police

if they move against me.

Welcome home... Dad.

Good to be home.

Light, how are your studies going?

Hmm? They're okay.

He's at the top of his grade as usual.

I'm very proud of my big brother!

I'm very proud of my son!

Dad, you seem a bit tired.

Yeah...

I can't tell you any details,
but this current case is very difficult.

I see...

Your father is with the police...

That must be the reason why
you're so confident.

Yeah.

I can hack into my father's computer
from my own without leaving a trace.

I can always keep track of
the investigative situation.

Here it is.

The police are beginning to
suspect that the culprit is a student.

Light, doesn't that mean
you're in trouble?

If the cause of death is written within
40 seconds of writing the person's name,

it will happen.

If the cause of death
is not specified,

the person will simply die
of a heart attack.

After writing the cause of death,

details of the death should be written
in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

Is that correct, Ryuk?

Yeah, so?

In other words, if I write "heart attack"
as the cause of death,

I can write down the circumstance
and time of death.

Looks like I may be able to provide you
with a little more entertainment, Ryuk.

Number 148, what's wrong?!

Get ahold of yourself!

SERIAL MURDER
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HQ

T- There were another
23 heart attack victims yesterday?!

Yes. The day before, there were
23 more victims.

One every hour...

The fact that this has continued for
two weekdays straight...

Means our sketch of the culprit
has become doubtful.

No, anyone could skip
school for two days...

That's not it!

It does appear less likely now
that the culprit's a student...

But that's not the message
Kira's trying to send!

Why one every hour?

And why are all the victims
in prisons,

where they can be easily found?

Kira is trying to say that...

he can freely control...
the time of death.

But something's not right...

As soon as we began to suspect that
Kira was a student,

the timing of the killings changed as
if to contradict our theory.

Is it a coincidence?
No, the timing is too convenient...

Does that mean that Kira knows
what the police know?

This is obviously
a direct challenge from him!

L is probably panicking by now.

I still have fifty criminals left
especially for times like this.

Oh...

Right now, L should be starting to suspect
someone involved with the police.

Kira has found a way to obtain information
from the task foroe headquarters.

I cannot ignore this fact.

What is Kira's real objective?
What is he trying to do?

But I don't get it.

By getting rid of the student theory,

aren't you at a bigger disadvantage if
L thinks you're connected to the police?

My reason is...

It's in order to find L
and finish him off.

What do you mean?

In human society, there are only a few
people who actually trust each other.

That's true even among police.

In particular, L and the police
don't trust each other at all.

Could you trust someone
whose name and face you don't know?

When L discovers that information
from the investigation was leaked...

he's bound to search for leads
on me within the police force.

When he does, it's only a matter of time
before the police get really mad.

On the surface,

L and the police are working
together to try to catch me.

But in reality...

L is investigating the police
and the police will start investigating L.

I'm not the one who's
going to find L.

The police will track him down.

And I will eliminate him!

LETTER OF RESIGNATION

As you can see, these are
our letters of resignation.

Transfer us to a different case.

If you can't, we will
quit the police force.

B- But why?

Why? Because we value our lives, sir.

By L's deduction,

Kira can kill people indirectly
through supernatural powers, right?

If I were Kira,

I would try to kill anyone
who tried to catch me.

That's because he'll be
executed if he gets caught.

Earlier, in that media stunt,
L challenged Kira.

"Try and kill me," he said.

But L never showed
his face or revealed his name.

Just recently, L ordered us
to find out

if the victims' faces and names
were broadcast in Japan.

That's right!

All the victims were people

whose faces were broadcast
to the Japanese public!

We...

unlike someone we know,

carry around our personal identification
as well as our photos in our police IDs.

We don't hide our faces,
we're out in the open!

We...

could be killed at any time by Kira...

This is why we wish to be
removed from our post.

Please excuse us.

H- Hey you!

Wait a second!

Here's the solution to this problem.

Take x squared equals... large x.

You can think of large X's
quadratic equation...

as the multiple of two integers.

FBI agents entered Japan four days ago.

They are currently investigating
the police involved.

This is the list, isn't it?

Yes.

There are 141 people within
the police force alone

who have access to classifi?ed
information on the Kira investigation.

But one of the 141 people
or someone close to them...

Kira is defi?nitely among them!

Light, you gotta second?

Didn't I tell you not to talk to me
as much as possible when we're outside?

How many times do I have to tell you?

Well then, I'm just gonna tell you.

Cover your ears if
you don't want to hear.

I don't have anything
against you, Light.

I think the notebook couldn't
have been picked up

by a better person.

And I have to stick around with you

until the notebook is finished
or you are.

But, I'm not on your side or L's side.

Ryuk, I know that much already.

That's why I'll never say
anything about

whether what you're doing is
right or wrong.

But I'm going to say this
as your roommate.

What's wrong, Ryuk?

Why are you telling me
this all of a sudden?

This isn't like you.

I'm going to tell you this,

not because I'm an ally of Kira,
but because it's creeping me out...

Get to the point already...

Someone's been following
you all this time.

He's been getting on my nerves.

He can't see me, but...

because I'm always hovering behind you,
I feel like I'm being watched.

That's a problem.

I'll get rid of him soon, Ryuk.

Just who is he?

Does that mean that L has
begun to suspect the police?

He must need quite a large number
of people to investigate them.

Even if he had
50 people investigating...

there is no chance that
I'd be suspected of being Kira.

I should seem like an ordinary
high school student.

But, if I leave it alone
for several months,

that possibility won't remain at zero.

I have to learn my shadow's name.

When I fi?nd that out,
I can get rid of him...

Light...

I'll let you in on something good...

There are two big differences
between...

Shinigami and humans
who have a Death Note.

Do you know why Shinigami have to
write peoples' names in the Death Note?

How would I know that?

You're really talkative today, Ryuk.

It's because Shinigami receive
the human's remaining life span from them.

"Receive their remaining life span"?

Let's say that there's a person who
will live 'til 60 in the Human World.

You write that he'll die
at forty in the Death Note.

Sixty minus forty equals twenty.

Those twenty years in the Human World
are added on to a Shinigami's life span.

As long as we don't slack off,

even if we're shot in the head
or stabbed in the heart with a knife,

Shinigami will not die.

But, no matter how many names
you write in the Death Note,

your life span will not lengthen.

That's the difference between Shinigami
and humans who have a Death Note.

Hmm...

To humans, that's very kind
of the Shinigami.

That's kinda interesting.

The second difference might even be
more interesting to you.

Instead of lengthening life,
it's about cutting it short.

Cutting it short?

When a Shinigami sees a person's face,
they know their name.

Do you know why?

A Shinigami's eyes...

...can see a human's name and lifespan above
their heads when we look at you.

Name... and lifespan?

LIGHT YAGAMI

If I convert it to human time,
I'll know how exactly how many years it is.

Of course, I wouldn't tell you even if
you stretched my mouth open...

Even if my mouth is
stretched out as it is.

Shinigami never have
problems knowing

the names of the people they kill.

They also know how much life
they're going to receive.

Our eyes are different.

That's the biggest difference
between you and me.

Shinigami can also turn the eyes
of whoever picked up their Death Note

into Shinigami eyes.

But only if a deal is made, one that's
been with us since ancient times.

A deal?

The price for a Shinigami's eyes...

is half of that human's
remaining lifetime.

Half of my remaining lifetime...

Yeah.

In other words,

if you were to live another 50 years,
you'll have 25 years left.

If it was one year more,
you'll have half a year.

And since you're neither
Kira's ally nor L's,

you won't tell me the name
of someone I want to kill,

even if you see their name.

In other words...
I can't count on your help.

Is that what you're trying to say?

Yeah.

It's also part of the Shinigami code.

I'll say this once more.

Give me half your remaining life
and I'll give you the Shinigami eyes.

If I do that...
I'll know everyone's name.

That will make it easier
to use the Death Note.

So...

Light, what'll it be?

TO BE CONTINUED

I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,

I threw away everything
that I didn't need

I'm holding these feelings

That I can't give up in my heart

Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifi?ce

In between reality and my ideal

I can't hold back
the flooding impulses

Because I have a strong desire

To accomplish

I'm not weak enough to believe

Any of these negative perceptions

I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude

PREVIEW

L DO YOU KNOW

Everything is going according to plan.

The Death Note never fails.

PURSUIT

Within the spreading darkness

I pledged a vow to the revolution

I can't let anybody interrupt it

I'm going to change

The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...

I'm going to change the dream

Into reality

The ending

That everybody wants

Within the spreading darkness

I pledged our vow to the revolution

I can't let anybody interrupt it

Someday I'll show you

A bright and ideal

World

What?!

There were another
23 heart attack victims yesterday?!

As soon as we began to suspect
that Kira was a student,

the timing of the killings changed as
if to contradict our theory.

Does that mean that Kira knows
what the police know?

When L discovers that information
from the investigation was leaked,

he's bound to search for leads on me
within the police force.

Someone's been following you
all this time.

That's a problem...

I'll get rid of him soon, Ryuk.

A Shinigami's eyes...

...can see a human's name
and lifespan above their heads.

into Shinigami eyes.

The price for a Shinigami's eyes...

is half of that human's remaining lifetime.

So...

Light, what'll it be?

PURSUIT

I haven't seen Ryuk around lately...

Did he really lose his Death Note
in the Human World?

The Death Note was probably picked up
by a human before he got to it.

Couldn't be...

If that happened to him, he'd have to
follow that person around

until that person dies
or the Death Note is destroyed.

Yeah... I can't picture Ryuk
doing something so tedious.

But I've heard that he was
carrying two Death Notes.

Seriously?
Why would he need two?

I have no idea what drives him to
do what he does.

In order for me to gain
the eyes of a Shinigami...

I have to offer half of my life.

Is that right?

Yeah.

So what'll it be?

Do you wanna make
a deal?

Ryuk.

This deal...
is out of the question.

Listen.

I want to create an ideal,
new world free from criminals.

I also intend to reign as
the god in that world for a long time.

I would consider it if
it lengthened my life,

but it's not worth talking
about if it's going to shorten it.

You, of all people,
should know that.

Yeah, I just felt I should tell
you a deal like this exists.

I don't want you to complain that
I didn't tell you about this earlier.

If you didn't tell me
about this earlier?

Don't you think
you're too late already?

You should have told me this
when we first met

or included this when you were writing
instructions in the Death Note...

Yeah. I guess you're right.

Even though I'm a Shinigami,

he's never been afraid of me or

tried to kiss my butt when
it comes to things like this.

He just gives me a hard time...

Well?

You sure there isn't anything else you
want to tell me ahead of time?

Ryuk, the Shinigami?

Nope, there's nothing else...

Probably...

I see.
How disappointing.

"Disappointing"?

I may have seriously
considered the deal

if you offered me wings
rather than eyes.

Wouldn't flying around in the sky
with wings be godlike?

It's a dream that man
has had since ancient times.

You'd stand out if you sprouted
wings and started flying around.

I'd bet you'd get arrested
by the police just for that.

Ryuk, that was a joke.

However, if I continue to
cut deals for eyes and wings...

I'm going to end up becoming
a real Shinigami.

That could be amusing,
don't you think?

Don't worry.

Even without all that,
you're already...

a fine Shinigami!

The Shinigami Realm is
rotten these days.

They all live vacant lives
and only take human lives...

just because they don't want to die.

No one even knows...

why we exist.

I doubt there's any reason
at all for our existence.

You're much more of
a Shinigami than they are.

Well, from what you're saying, it sounds
like I'm doing a lot more work.

But don't lump me together
with the Shinigami.

I am using this Death Note
as a human for humans.

But, I wouldn't say that
the Shinigami Realm

is meaningless to humans either.

What do you mean?

Well, think about it.

Whenever a Shinigami like you
comes to the Human World

once every hundred, no,
every thousand years,

the Human World
changes greatly.

The Shinigami Realm's existence
is fear-fully meaningful.

I- Is that so?

You just told me that
the Shinigami Realm is rotten.

When you return there,
from this world,

how about using what you've
learned here to try to change it?

Light... you just may be
quite the positive thinker.

Of course, I am.

If I wasn't, I wouldn't be
trying to use

the Death Note to try and
make the world a better place.

That's it!

I've got it!

What's up?
What did you get?

How to find out the name of
the guy who was following me today.

How are you going to do it?

I'm going to use the rules of
the Death Note to my advantage.

If I write the cause of death...

I have an additional
6 minutes and 40 seconds

to record specific conditions
and time of death.

I wonder how free I can
be with these conditions?

I'm going to test it out.

THE FOLLOWING MORNING

Yes, it's me.

Another six inmates?

All heart attacks?!

It's Kira.

What?

Three of them exhibited bizarre behavior
before they died?!

What do you mean?!

They didn't just die from
simple heart attacks?

Well, they died of heart attacks,
but before one of them died...

he drew a strange symbol
on the wall with blood from his finger.

Another left a letter that doesn't seem
like a will or anything meaningful.

The third escaped just to go
to the employee bathroom.

Watari, what is it?

More victims, but their circumstances
are unlike those we've had before.

Unlike those before?

I shall send you an image of
the picture and letter left at the scene.

If you could.

A note describing a fear of Kira.

This can be taken as
something a criminal might do, but...

Kira can control the time of death.

If he can control actions
right before death as well...

that would mean that...

Chief!

Regarding these current victims.

Don't let the media know anything

aside from the fact that
they died of heart attacks.

It's possible that Kira
was performing some kind of test.

If that's the case, we'd only
be giving him the results.

I see...

|- | understand.

Performing tests on criminals?

That's horrible...

He's playing with peoples' lives
as if this is a game.

This is unforgivable!

If Kira is using criminals
as test subjects...

What is he trying to achieve?

Look at this, Ryuk.

The results of yesterday's test have
already been input into Dad's computer.

KIDNAPPING MURDER

KIDNAPPING MURDER

What do you mean by that?

One escaped...

and went to the bathroom
I had designated in the Death Note.

Another drew the same symbol
I had drawn in the Death Note.

These three did exactly what I wanted.

I purposely wrote very difficult tasks
for the other three.

DIES IN FRONT OF THE
EIFFEL TOWER FRANCE, TODAY AT 6 P.M.

It's physically impossible to go from
a prison in Japan to France in an hour.

So this never happened and ended
as just a regular heart attack.

The next was to "draw a picture of L's face
on the prison wall," but...

One can't draw the faces...
of people they don't know.

I see.

HEART ATTACK WRITES A NOTE STATING "I KNOW
THAT L IS SUSPICIOUS OF THE JAPANESE POLICE." DIES AT 6 P.M.

I thought this one might work,
but it didn't happen.

Which means that people can't write

about things they don't know or things
they didn't come up with on their own.

In short, it means that even
the Death Note can't do the impossible.

But as long as it's something
the person is realistically likely to do,

I can control them as much as
I want before he dies.

You've figured that out...

But what are you trying to do, Light?

L and the police will never
figure out my true goal.

The great detective
is probably trying

to decipher the picture and
the letter those criminals left.

They're absolutely meaningless
f?nal words...

If Kira used those criminals as guinea pigs,
he's about to start something.

If he moves now,
there is the chance that...

the FBI will notice someone
acting suspiciously.

But if he has a different goal in mind...

the letter and picture might
be some kind of message...

Is this it?

L DO YOU KNOW

Well... It's time for the main act.

The "main act"?

Yesterday on the news...

There was a drug addict who tried
to rob a bank,

WANTED CRIMINAL
KIICHIRO OSOREDA

I'll use him.

It's last minute, but I'm sure
I can find someone...

I'll try to ask out a few.

Ask out... "a few"?

Yeah... Ryuk, I may not look it,
but I'm pretty popular.

Hello? Huh, Light?
Good morning...

He's still following me, isn't he?

That's perfect.

If my shadow wasn't here,

there would be no point in what
I'm going to do next.

Light!

- A date?
- Yeah.

It's a date,
no matter how you look at it.

Even to my shadow...

It's not a normal date, is it?

You said you found a way
to find out your shadow's name, but...

What do you plan to do?

Huh? Ryuk, didn't you see
what I wrote in the Death Note?

Nah. It would be boring to peek.

Then just be patient and
watch what happens.

Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

No, not at all!

Anyway, I haven't been to
Space Land since junior high!

I'm so excited!
And I get to be alone with you!

Y- Yeah.

On weekdays, he only goes
to school and his prep courses.

An occasional date on his days off.
He's a normal...

...no, he is a serious
high school student.

Light Yagami, son of Chief Yagami...

No grounds for suspicion.

At any rate...

Today is my last day of
following him.

Light...

Didn't you say that you weren't going out
until entrance exams were over?

Yeah, but I did score number one
in the practice exams.

Your attitude's awful!

It's him! He's here!

Aside from him,
there are seven passengers.

This is going to work out perfectly.

I'm taking control of this bus!

A hijacking!
At a time like this?

Don't make a fuss!
I'll kill anyone that moves.

Driver, you know the phone number
for Space Land's offices, don't you?

- Call them!
- Yes...

T- This is Sasaki, the driver of
bus number 174!

Tell them what's happening!

An armed man has
hijacked our bus!

Give me that.

You hear that? Listen carefully.

Bring Space Land's profits from yesterday
to two bus stops away from there.

Have a woman bring it
by car, alone!

Do it before this bus gets there!

If you try anything funny...

or call the police,
I'll kill all the passengers one by one!

Yuri, don't worry.

I'll look for the chance
to grab his hand...

that's holding the pistol.

That's dangerous. Don't do it.

If it comes to that, I'll do it.

It's all right.
We don't have to pass notes.

As long as we whisper, he won't hear us
over the sound of the bus.

Do you have proof that
you're not his accomplice?

A- Accomplice?

It's pretty common.

The culprit pretends he's alone
and just in case...

he'll leave someone to
keep watch in the back.

What's wrong?

Oh no, do you really think...?

I- I have no choice.

There is no way that
Light Yagami could be Kira.

Kira could kill the culprit
with a heart attack.

Here's proof.
Take a look.

FBI?!

I see, L's using the FBI to investigate
those connected to the Japanese police force!

His name is...
Raye Penber.

I trust you.

I won't ask why an FBI agent
is on board with us... but...

- Do you have a gun?
- Yes, I do.

So if something happens,
I can rely on you, right?

Yes.

Shut up!

Do you want me to beat you to death?

That man! He was on
the Japanese news two days ago.

He's a drug addict who tried
to rob a bank,

killed three civilians,
and ran away.

He's very dangerous.

Every thing will be all right.
He'll never point his gun at us.

Hey, you! Don't move.

What's that piece of paper?

Hey you!

You were planning something back here
with notes, weren't you?

Not good!

If he sees that note from earlier...

He'll discover that Light was planning
to jump him when he had the chance!

MINAMI PARK BUS STOP 11:27
SPACELAND BUS STOP

All right!

W- Who the hell are you?!

You in the back!
W- What are you trying to pull?

H- How long were you
hiding back there?!

Huh? You mean me?
You can see me right now?

D- Don't move!

I- I'll shoot!
You monster!

This isn't good!
He's hallucinating!

Everyone, get down!

Oh, I get it!

That note that Light just dropped...

was cut out of the Death Note.

He has this guy touch the note
and how, only he can see me.

That's so smart.

D- Don't come near me!

Sorry, pal.

I'm a Shinigami,
so that's not gonna kill me.

"Anyone who touches the Death Note
will be able to see me...

"I'm always hovering behind you. "

"Shinigami can't die from gunshots..

That's all stuff I've told Light...

Pretty impressive,
how he put it all together.

It's not surprising he's the nation's top
exam scorer...

He even used this hijacking

to get the name of the guy
who was following him...

without a lot of hassle.

Stop the bus and open the door.

SPACELAND

11:45 on the dot.
Right on schedule...

Wanted criminal, Kiichiro Osoreda,
accidental death.

At 11:31 a. m., he will get on
a bus heading to Spaceland

from the bus stop near
the eastern entrance of the park.

He will enter with a gun,

but will see a phantom from another
world and fires all his bullets at it.

Then, he will flee from the bus...

Immediately afterwards, at 11:45
the same day,

he will die in an accident.

The Death Note never deviates.

You're next, Raye Penber.

DECEMBER 20, 11:50 AM

Hey...

Yes?

I'm actually here in Japan on
a secret investigation.

If the Japanese police were to...

I understand.

I won't tell anyone that I met you.

Including my father...

Please excuse me...

It's just as I thought.

I also don't want the police
to know

that I've come into contact
with an FBI agent.

If my father ever found out,
he'd tell L.

Raye doesn't suspect me at all...

The police will deal with
what happened just now

as a regular accident.

Welcome back.

Good to be back.

What's the matter?
Why the big sigh?

Raye... What happened?

I got mixed up in a bus jacking.

A "bus-jacking"?

A man who robbed a bank
two days ago tried to hijack a bus.

Japan has become a scary place.

Does that mean you were
also riding on that bus?

Yeah.

In the end, the suspect jumped
out of the bus and was hit by a car.

Did the suspect die?

Yeah. Probably...

I didn't have any time to
watch what happened.

Raye...

Do you really think
that was an accident?

What do you mean?

Well, you were on that bus

because you were investigating
someone, weren't you?

The criminal probably died...

Doesn't that mean...

Hey, you were indeed once
a brilliant FBI agent.

But now you're my fiancée.

You're no longer an agent.

Don't say anything about
the Kira case.

Don't get involved or take risks.

That's what we agreed on

when I brought you with me here
so we could meet your parents.

I understand, Raye.

It's just a force of habit.

Sorry.

No, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

Once we have a family,

you'll be so busy that
you'll forget that you were an agent.

You won't have time
for that habit to come out.

Instead, help me think of something that
will make that father of yours like me more.

Oh...

Are you going to write down
the name of the agent now?

No. I'm going to write his name
a week from today.

If he dies right after I meet him,
I'll look suspicious.

It would be better to do it

once they've investigated
more people involved with the police.

For now, I'll use some
more inmates to toy with L.

L.

There is another dying
message left by a victim.

Please send an image to me.

Gods of Death...

"L, do you know? Gods of Death. "

Does he want to say
that Gods of Death exist?

Watari.

Tell the police to keep
watch on the prison.

There may be someone else
who will leave a message.

I understand.

DECEMBER 27, 3:00 PM

There sure are a lot of humans...

Are you going to do it here?

I'll show you what I've learned

from all of the experiments and research
I've done in the past few days...

"Experiments"?

Yes.

I've been testing different killing
methods on the criminals in this area...

ACCIDENTAL DEATH DECEMBER 26, 8:30
PM DIES AFTER GETTING HIT BY A CAR.

Then, when I write a name
in afterwards, it becomes true.

That's something even I didn't know...

He's here...

Right on time...

Mr. Raye Penber.

I'll kill you if you turn around.

I am Kira.

If you turn around or
put your hand in your pocket,

I Will kill you.

I- It couldn't be...

But this voice...
I've heard it somewhere...

I shall first prove to
you that I am Kira.

I'll kill the man
with the glasses...

working at the coffee shop
you are looking at.

T- That's impossible!

Don't do it!

I had no choice.

I thought that if I didn't kill
at least one person,

you wouldn't believe me.

That man has been repeatedly
accused of sexual assault,

but the police have never convicted
him due to lack of evidence.

He was a menace and
deserved to be punished.

You may already have
heard from L,

that I cannot kill someone
unless I know his face.

I could kill everyone you see here.

If you have any requests,
I'll do it.

D- Don't do it.

I believe that you're Kira...

Of course, you care more about
your loved ones more

than the people here, don't you?

Consider them hostages.

Y- You know about her?!

That's right.

I've been studying you.

I will kill everyone,

including your family if
you don't do exactly as I say.

You included, of course.

|- | understand.

What do you want me to do?

You have a computer
with you, don't you?

Is there a file on the agents
who've come to Japan?

My laptop is for work. I always
carry it around with me.

But those files aren't in it.

Then take this envelope.

First, take out the transceiver
and put on the earphone.

A transceiver...

It's almost like a toy...

But this won't leave
a transmission record anywhere

and we can converse at
close distances even underground.

He's thought this out.

Please take the Yamanote Line.

It doesn't matter if you take
the inner circle or outer circle.

SHIBUYA - SHINAGAWA

Even while you're on the train,
keep your eyes forward...

...focused on one spot.

Don't forget, I can kill at any time.

Once you're on the train,
sit in the corner closest to the door.

If it's taken, wait until it's free.

First, I must tell you something.

If your answer differs signiﬁcantly
from what I expect,

I will kill your girlfriend.

Of the FBI agents who have
come to Japan,

how many are there and
how are they organized?

Please answer
into the transceiver.

I've heard it's f-four teams...

a total of twelve people...

Next, take out what's in the envelope.

What... is this?

Of those investigators...

Write the name of the agent
who is directly in charge of you all...

in the space at the top.

What is the meaning of this?

What is he planning?

But I have to do as he says.

He shouldn't be able to kill
with just names alone...

Next, open your laptop.

You should be receiving
a ﬁle from your superior soon.

A ﬁle of all the names and faces
of the FBI agents who came to Japan.

T- This is... What's going on?

Now, like you just did,

take a good look at each agent's face as
you write their names on the envelope.

I don't understand.

What is Kira trying to do?

What is he doing?

It seems like you're done.

Now put the transceiver and
envelope with the names on it

back into their original envelope
and put them on the rack.

Now put your hands on your lap
and continue riding the train

without making any movements for
about thirty minutes.

When you are sure that
nobody has noticed

that you have forgotten the envelope...
get off of the train.

Why? Why can't I remember
that voice?

Kira...

Who are you?

Light... Yagami...

Farewell, Raye Penber.

Raye Penber wrote those names
on pages taken from the Death Note.

He unwittingly killed
all of his colleagues.

Penber's superior died after sending him
the ﬁle on all of the agents.

The rest of the agents all died
of heart attacks

after the ﬁle was received.

L... We have a call
from the Director of the FBI.

It's me...

I've just got word
from Japan that

all of our agents have died.

They all died of heart attacks.

I can only think that
Kira killed them.

L, I'm very sorry, but...

The FBI will call off
our investigation in Japan.

It's from Chief Yagami.

L, I've just spoken with
the FBI Director.

According to him,

you were investigating everyone here
involved with the task force.

Yes.

What is the meaning of this?

Are you saying that you suspect us?

I decided that it was necessary
to learn Kira's identity.

I cannot condone this.

I cannot believe
that you would spy...

on your colleagues...

We can't trust L...

Besides, Kira killed
those FBI agents, right?

Even if they're not criminals,

he'll kill anyone who
stands in his way!

Kira's really just a murderer!

L. Another victim has
left a message.

L, do you know? Gods of Death...

love apples...

Damn you, Kira!

Raye's... dead...

No, he was killed by Kira...

What? A family meeting?

Even if I kept it secret,
you'd find out sooner or later.

So I'm going to tell you now.

I am currently in charge of
conducting the Kira investigation.

No way!

Dad, you really are amazing.

That isn't what I wanted to say.

Yesterday...

twelve FBI agents,
sent to Japan to find Kira, died.

Does that mean that
they were killed by Kira?

What?!

It means Kira might kill anyone
who tries to apprehend him...

It's a cold
and ruthless crime

more fearsome than anything
we've encountered before.

Many of my officers have quit.

Dad, you should quit too!

I don't want you to die!

She's right. You should place
your life before your job.

No. I will not remove myself
from this case.

I will not yield to evil.

Dad...

Dear...

Dad, that's admirable.
I'm proud of you.

If anything ever happens to you,

I'll see that
Kira gets executed.

Kira will probably kill all who
oppose him,

even if they're not criminals.

We may all be killed by Kira...

Think of your lives,
your families, and friends.

If anyone wants to be removed
from this investigation, please resign.

If you resign,
you will not be demoted.

I promise you.

I want those with the confidence
to stay on the case to fight Kira,

even if going after him means
sacrificing everything.

That is all.

Hey...
What are you going to do?

Yeah...

Yeah, right, that's him.

I remember him because
he said, "Get down. "

But I don't really remember
the other passengers...

I see.

I understand.
Thank you very much.

If what I'm thinking is correct,

Kira could have been
among those passengers...

If that's so, I can ﬁnd Kira
along the path this bus takes.

SERIAL MURDER
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HQ

Only five people, huh?
Six including myself.

No, I should say as many as five
of you are willing to risk your lives.

I trust all of you who have
a strong sense of justice.

W- Wait just a moment.

L says he trusts us, but...

We don't trust L.

L, we have decided to
risk our lives to catch Kira.

You should know what
we mean by that.

But you never show your face
and just order us around...

We cannot work with
someone like that!

L.

If you want to work with us
and want to catch Kira...

Would it be possible for
you to come here?

Earlier, I said that I trust you all.

PLEASE KEEP WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
A SECRET BETWEEN THE EIGHT OF US.

I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THE SIX OF YOU,
WHOM I TRUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

BEFORE THAT, I WANT YOU ALL TO GO
OUTSIDE OF THE POLICE BUILDING

AND DECIDE ONCE MORE
IF YOU TRUST ME OR NOT.

NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY AND
NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY COMMISSION

Why does he suddenly
want to work with just the six of us?

If he's solved numerous difficult
cases by himself,

he should do the same
this time, too.

And judging by the way that L
has been conducting the investigation,

he'll probably send a double
to meet us.

A double, huh? It's possible...

|- | trust L.

I also think we need L's help
in this case.

Me too...

L said from the beginning that...

he needed the police's help
in this case.

Perhaps you could
think of it like this.

L was waiting
for this to happen.

For what to happen?

There were people
in the investigation

who distrusted L
from the beginning.

Then we had detectives
continuously resign...

and confidential information
was leaked.

You can't run an investigation
unless you trust your partners.

In other words, L was waiting
for the task force

to get down to the people he can trust

and who will face evil
without fear.

Yes.

I'll resign rather than
join up with L.

Don't worry.

I won't trail you and
try to find L.

I trust L and will try
to cooperate with him.

Me too...

I am currently in a room
at the 719/70 Hotel.

I shall be switching hotels from
now on every few days.

From now on, I want you to
think of these rooms as...

the de facto HQ of
the investigation.

If you can agree to these terms...

I want you to split into two groups,
with a 30-minute interval between you,

and come here by...
twelve o'clock midnight.

Kira, we're even in how far we've
closed the distance between us.

Fine.

I'll show myself to others as L
for the ﬁrst time.

If you manage to ﬁnd out
about this, you'll deﬁnitely move in closer.

Bring it on.

I did a lot these past few days.

Think.

Was there something that I missed?

And... what is my next move?

L, the real battle starts now.

Please come in.

TO BE CONTINUED

I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,

I threw away everything
that I didn't need

I'm holding these feelings

That I can't give up in my heart

Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce

In between reality and my ideal

I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses

Because I have a strong desire

To accomplish

I'm not weak enough to believe

Any of these negative perceptions

I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude

This Shinigami may not be on my side,
but it looks like another god is.
